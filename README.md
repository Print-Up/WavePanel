# WavePanel
The Wave Panel is an open-source acoustic treatment solution that combines diffusion and absorption into one 3D printable panel. 

## Printable Parts
Each size variant contains 2 printable files:
- TopPanel
- BottomPanel

The <b><i>Top Panel</i></b> is the part that will attach to the bottom panel (once mounted on the wall and filled with treatment) and also contains your model for infill creation. This model with its infill will serve as 'diffusion'. See the guide on how to configure your slicer for this.

The <b><i>Bottom Panel</i></b> is the part that attaches to the wall and holds your acoustic treatment materials.
